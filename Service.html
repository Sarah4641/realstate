  <h2>Build Equity and Wealth</h2>
  <p>As you pay down a property mortgage with Real Estate Hub, you build equity—an asset that's part of your net worth. And as you build equity, you have the leverage to buy more properties and increase cash flow and wealth even more.</p>

  <h2>Real Estate Investment Trusts (ITs)</h2>
  <p>If you want to invest in real estate, but aren't ready to make the jump into owning and managing properties, you may want to consider a real estate investment trust (REIT). You can buy and sell publicly-traded REITs on major stock exchanges. Many trade under high volume, meaning you can get into and out of a position quickly. REITs must pay out 90% of income to investors, so they typically offer higher dividends than many stocks.</p>

  <h2>Inspection Services on Behalf of Clients</h2>
  <p>Some buyers and sellers carry out the inspection process on their own because they do not know that this is their responsibility. Inspection is an essential process that agents ought to go through. Some professional inspectors have the skills of examining possessions. 

    Good agencies offer inspection before they put assets on sale. They take this seriously because they value the welfare of both purchasers and sellers. From the inspection report, they can come up with a pricing decision and determine if the renovation is compulsory. </p>

    <p>I just recently sold my home with Real Estate Hub. The whole process from beginning to end was very easy and painless. Being the first house we’ve ever sold, I can tell you we had a lot of questions. 
      We never could have gone through this without Real Estate Hub.
      She was amazing!! 
      Thanks To Real Estate Hub!!</p>

    <p>Real Estate Hub made selling our house a smooth and pleasant experience. They knew exactly what to do at every step of the process and gave us excellent guidance along the way. Specifically our realtor Sarah was extremely helpful and responsive. We could not have been happier working with her! She remained confident when we encountered challenges and always kept us on target. I would highly recommend Real Estate Hub to anyone selling or buying a house. They are the ultimate professionals!</p>

    <p>I typically do not write a review for anything or anyone, but the outstanding service I received from Real Estate Hub calls for an exception. Sarah put quality over quantity when it came to helping my family and I secure a home. What I mean by quality is we were not just a “number” to her, she genuinely cared to get to know us and familiarize herself with what we were comfortable with when purchasing a home. Sarah was 100% professional at all times, patient with our us, and knew when to be aggressive in order to get us under contract! 
      We greatly appreciate everything she did for us. Thanks again Sarah!</p>
